Christopher Donahue, President Not FDIC Insured May Lose Value No Bank Guarantee CONTENTS Management s Discussion of Fund Performance (unaudited) The total return of the Federated Hermes Short Duration High Yield ETF (the Fund ), based on net asset value ( NAV ) for the reporting period ended February 28, 2022, since the Fund s inception date of December 16 th , 2021, was -1.74%. The -1.74% total return for the Fund during the reporting period consisted of 0.98% of dividends and reinvestments and -2.72% of price loss in the net asset value of the Fund. The total return based on the market price of the Fund s shares was -1.42% for the same period. 1 The total return for the ICE BofA 0-3 Year Duration-to-Worst US High Yield Constrained Index (IBA0-3HY), 2,3 the Fund s broad-based securities market index, was -0.98% during the same period. The Fund s total return during the reporting period reflected actual cash flows, transaction costs and expenses which were not reflected in the total return of the IBA0-3HY. During the reporting period, the primary components of the Fund s investment strategy which affected performance relative to the IBA0-3HY were: (a) allocation of Fund assets among the following two broad sectors: domestic noninvestment-grade 4,5 bonds and domestic noninvestment-grade loans; 6 (b) allocation of the Fund s domestic noninvestment-grade bonds to specific duration buckets; 7 and (c) the selection of securities within each of the Fund s sectors. MARKET OVERVIEW During the reporting period, investors expectations regarding inflation shifted dramatically. Inflation was no longer viewed as transitory, but instead, as something more persistent and structural. That shifted investor s expectations about the pace of rate increases by the Federal Reserve, causing a rapid upward movement in U.S. Treasury rates which led to a negative repricing for all U.S. risk assets. In fact, the shift in inflation expectations and the subsequent move in U.S. Treasury interest rates explained most of the performance for nearly all risk asset classes during the period. Accordingly, domestic leveraged finance asset classes generated negative absolute total returns. This included both the U.S. high-yield and leveraged loan markets. Even shorter duration bonds, whose lower interest rate sensitivity helps shield their prices from the impact of interest rate moves, were not immune to the repricing. The par-weighted average price of bonds in the IBA0-3HY decreased from $103.33 to $100.92 during the reporting period. The decrease in prices was only modestly offset by the current income stream thus leading to a negative total return for the asset class. Adding to this volatility was the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February which led to spikes in the prices of commodities, particularly oil and wheat, two key outputs from the region. Additionally, Ukraine s production of neon gas, a critical input to the manufacturing of semiconductors, was halted. Annual Shareholder Report 1 Ukraine produces roughly 50% of the global supply of neon gas so the stoppage of production created another unwanted constraint to the semiconductor supply chain, which had been suffering for over a year because of Covid-19. The lack of semiconductors hampered auto sales leading to significant inflation in both new and used vehicle prices. These events not only exacerbated fears of lasting inflation, but as oil moved above $100 per barrel, investors began to price in higher odds of an economic slowdown. Credit risk spreads widened materially, and asset prices decreased as prospects for a sustained recovery from the Covid-19-induced recession quickly faded. Despite these macro and geopolitical moves, the corporate and credit fundamental factors of both leveraged loans and high-yield bonds continued to be quite strong. Robust customer end demand for goods and services had many companies reporting growing revenues and profits even in the face of higher input costs and supply chain bottlenecks. That led to few credit mishaps and pushed the issuer default rate in leveraged finance markets even lower during the reporting period. Fund Performance During the reporting period, the Fund invested in a portfolio that was widely diversified 8 over industry sectors and issuers and was comprised of corporate bonds, floating-rate bank loans, 9 collateralized loan obligations ( CLO ) and cash. The Fund s sector allocations to leveraged loans and CLOs were a positive contributor to performance relative to the IBA0-3HY. In the early part of the reporting period, the Fund had roughly an 8% weighting to leveraged loans and that grew to roughly 14% by the end of the period. The Fund s overweight allocation to higher duration high-yield bonds negatively impacted returns relative to the IBA0-3HY. Given the rate-driven selloff in risk asset classes, high-yield bonds with a higher duration underperformed those with a lower duration. After adjusting for duration, security selection was a negative contributor to performance during the period. Annual Shareholder Report 2 1 This assumes the shares were purchased on December 17, 2021, the first day of trading on an exchange, and all dividends were reinvested into new shares of the Fund. The difference between the Fund s NAV return and the Fund s share return based on the market price reflects one fewer day in the reporting period for the shares and the premium or discount of the market price relative to the NAV. 2 Please see the footnotes to the line graphs below for definitions of, and further information about, the IBA0-3HY. 3 High-yield, lower-rated securities generally entail greater market, credit and liquidity risks than investment-grade securities and may include higher volatility and a higher risk of default. 4 Investment-grade securities are securities that are rated at least BBB or unrated securities of a comparable quality. Noninvestment-grade securities are securities that are not rated at least BBB or unrated securities of a comparable quality. Credit ratings are an indication of the risk that a security will default. They do not protect a security from credit risk. Lower-rated bonds typically offer higher yields to help compensate investors for the increased risk associated with them. Among these risks are lower creditworthiness, greater price volatility, more risk to principal and income that with higher-rated securities and increased possibilities of default. 5 Bond prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates, and a rise in interest rates can cause a decline in their prices. Issuers of fixed-income securities may fail to pay interest or principal on those securities when due, which may reduce the value of the Fund s portfolio holdings, its share price and its performance. 6 In addition to the risks generally associated with debt instruments, such as credit, market, interest rate, liquidity and derivatives risks, bank loans are also subject to the risk that the value of the collateral securing a loan may decline, be insufficient to meet the obligations of the borrower, or be difficult to liquidate. 7 Duration is a measure of a security s price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Securities with longer durations are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than securities of shorter durations. 8 Diversification does not assure a profit nor protect against loss. 9 Variable and floating rate loans and securities generally are less sensitive to interest rate changes but may decline in value if their interest rates do not rise as much or as quickly as interest rates in general. Conversely, variable and floating rate loans and securities generally will not increase in value as much as fixed rate debt instruments if interest rates decline. Annual Shareholder Report 3 FUND PERFORMANCE AND GROWTH OF A $10,000 INVESTMENT The graph below illustrates the hypothetical investment of $10,000 1 in the Federated Hermes Short Duration High Yield ETF (the Fund ) from December 16, 2021 to February 28, 2022, compared to the ICE BofA 0-3 Year Duration-to-Worst US High Yield Constrained Index (IBA0-3HY). 2 The Average Annual Total Return table below shows returns averaged over the stated periods. Growth of a $10,000 Investment Growth of $10,000 as of February 28, 2022 Average Annual Total Returns for the Period Ended 2/28/2022 Annual Shareholder Report 4 Performance data quoted represents past performance which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Fund performance changes over time and current performance may be lower or higher than what is stated. For current to the most recent month-end performance and after-tax returns, visit FederatedInvestors.com or call 1-800-341-7400. Returns shown do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption of Fund shares. Funds are not obligations of or guaranteed by any bank and are not federally insured. 1 The Fund s performance assumes the reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. The IBA0- 3HY has been adjusted to reflect reinvestment of dividends on securities in the index and the average. 2 The IBA0-3HY tracks the performance of short-term U.S. dollar denominated below investment- grade corporate debt publicly issued in the U.S. domestic market. Qualifying securities must have a duration-to-worst less than three years, a remaining to final maturity of at least one month, at least 18 months to final maturity at point of issuance, a below investment-grade rating (based on an average of Moody s, S P and Fitch), a fixed coupon schedule and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. The IBA0-3HY is not adjusted to reflect sales charges, expenses or other fees that the Securities and Exchange Commission requires to be reflected in the Fund s performance. The index is unmanaged and, unlike the Fund, is not affected by cash flows. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

ORGANIZATION Federated Hermes ETF Trust (the Trust ) was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on August 24, 2011 and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Act ), as an open-end management investment company. The Trust consists of two portfolios. The financial statements included herein are only those of Federated Hermes Short Duration High Yield ETF (the Fund ). The Fund s investment objective is to seek high current income. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange during the trading day. The Fund s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca. Any amount of shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly traded companies, and when you buy or sell the Fund s shares in the secondary market, you will pay or receive the market price. However, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market will develop or be maintained, or that the Fund shares listing will continue or remain unchanged. Shares of the Fund may only be acquired through the Fund s distributor and redeemed directly with the Fund by or through an Authorized Participant in large blocks called Creation Units or multiples thereof. Authorized Participants are registered clearing agents that enter into an agreement with the Fund s distributor to transact in Creation Units. Purchases and redemptions of Creation Units will take place in-kind and/or for cash at the discretion of the Fund. The determination of whether purchases and redemptions of Creation Units will be for cash or in-kind depends primarily on the regulatory requirements and settlement mechanisms relevant to the Fund s portfolio holdings and the Fund is not limited to engaging in in-kind transactions to any particular market circumstances. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. These policies are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Investment Valuation In calculating its net asset value (NAV), the Fund generally values investments as follows: Fixed-income securities are fair valued using price evaluations provided by a pricing service approved by the Fund s Board of Trustees (the Trustees ). Shares of mutual funds or non-exchange-traded investment companies are valued based upon their reported NAVs, or NAV per share practical expedient, as applicable. Equity securities listed on an exchange or traded through a regulated market system are valued at their last reported sale price or official closing price in their principal exchange or market. Derivative contracts listed on exchanges are valued at their reported settlement or closing price, except that options are valued at the mean of closing bid and asked quotations. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts are fair valued using price evaluations provided by a pricing service approved by the Trustees. Annual Shareholder Report 18 For securities that are fair valued in accordance with procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Trustees, certain factors may be considered, such as: the last traded or purchase price of the security, information obtained by contacting the issuer or dealers, analysis of the issuer s financial statements or other available documents, fundamental analytical data, the nature and duration of restrictions on disposition, the movement of the market in which the security is normally traded, public trading in similar securities or derivative contracts of the issuer or comparable issuers, movement of a relevant index, or other factors including but not limited to industry changes and relevant government actions. If any price, quotation, price evaluation or other pricing source is not readily available when the NAV is calculated, if the Fund cannot obtain price evaluations from a pricing service or from more than one dealer for an investment within a reasonable period of time as set forth in the Fund s valuation policies and procedures, or if information furnished by a pricing service, in the opinion of the valuation committee ( Valuation Committee ), is deemed not representative of the fair value of such security, the Fund uses the fair value of the investment determined in accordance with the procedures described below. There can be no assurance that the Fund could obtain the fair value assigned to an investment if it sold the investment at approximately the time at which the Fund determines its NAV per share, and the actual value obtained could be materially different. The trading prices of the Fund s shares listed on its exchange may differ from the Fund s NAV and will normally be affected by market forces, such as supply and demand, economic conditions, the market value of the Fund s disclosed portfolio holdings and other factors. As a result, trading prices may be lower, higher or the same as the Fund s NAV; and investors may pay more than NAV when buying shares and receive less than NAV when selling shares through the exchange. Fair Valuation and Significant Events Procedures The Trustees have ultimate responsibility for determining the fair value of investments for which market quotations are not readily available. The Trustees have appointed a Valuation Committee comprised of officers of the Fund, Federated Investment Management Company (the Adviser ) and certain of the Adviser s affiliated companies to assist in determining fair value and in overseeing the calculation of the NAV. The Trustees have also authorized the use of pricing services recommended by the Valuation Committee to provide fair value evaluations of the current value of certain investments for purposes of calculating the NAV. The Valuation Committee employs various methods for reviewing third-party pricing-service evaluations including periodic reviews of third-party pricing services policies, procedures and valuation methods (including key inputs, methods, models and assumptions), transactional back-testing, comparisons of evaluations of different pricing services, and review of price challenges by the Adviser based on recent market activity. In the event that market quotations and price evaluations are not available for an investment, the Valuation Committee determines the fair value of the investment in accordance with procedures adopted by the Trustees. The Trustees periodically review and approve the fair valuations made by the Valuation Committee and any changes made to the procedures. Factors considered by pricing services in evaluating an investment include the yields or prices of investments of comparable quality, coupon, maturity, call rights and other potential prepayments, terms and type, reported transactions, indications as to values from dealers and general market conditions. Some pricing services provide a single Annual Shareholder Report 19 price evaluation reflecting the bid-side of the market for an investment (a bid evaluation). Other pricing services offer both bid evaluations and price evaluations indicative of a price between the prices bid and asked for the investment (a mid evaluation). The Fund normally uses bid evaluations for any U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. The Fund normally uses mid evaluations for any other types of fixed-income securities and any OTC derivative contracts. In the event that market quotations and price evaluations are not available for an investment, the fair value of the investment is determined in accordance with procedures adopted by the Trustees. The Trustees also have adopted procedures requiring an investment to be priced at its fair value whenever the Adviser determines that a significant event affecting the value of the investment has occurred between the time as of which the price of the investment would otherwise be determined and the time as of which the NAV is computed. An event is considered significant if there is both an affirmative expectation that the investment s value will change in response to the event and a reasonable basis for quantifying the resulting change in value. Examples of significant events that may occur after the close of the principal market on which a security is traded, or after the time of a price evaluation provided by a pricing service or a dealer, include: With respect to securities traded principally in foreign markets, significant trends in U.S. equity markets or in the trading of foreign securities index futures contracts; Political or other developments affecting the economy or markets in which an issuer conducts its operations or its securities are traded; Announcements concerning matters such as acquisitions, recapitalizations, litigation developments, or a natural disaster affecting the issuer s operations or regulatory changes or market developments affecting the issuer s industry. The Trustees have adopted procedures whereby the Valuation Committee uses a pricing service to provide factors to update the fair value of equity securities traded principally in foreign markets from the time of the close of their respective foreign stock exchanges to the pricing time of the Fund. For other significant events, the Fund may seek to obtain more current quotations or price evaluations from alternative pricing sources. If a reliable alternative pricing source is not available, the Fund will determine the fair value of the investment in accordance with the fair valuation procedures approved by the Trustees. The Trustees have ultimate responsibility for any fair valuations made in response to a significant event. Repurchase Agreements The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements for short-term liquidity purposes. It is the policy of the Fund to require the other party to a repurchase agreement to transfer to the Fund s custodian or sub-custodian eligible securities or cash with a market value (after transaction costs) at least equal to the repurchase price to be paid under the repurchase agreement. The eligible securities are transferred to accounts with the custodian or sub-custodian in which the Fund holds a securities entitlement and exercises control as those terms are defined in the Uniform Commercial Code. The Fund has established procedures for monitoring the market value of the transferred Annual Shareholder Report 20 securities and requiring the transfer of additional eligible securities if necessary to equal at least the repurchase price. These procedures also allow the other party to require securities to be transferred from the account to the extent that their market value exceeds the repurchase price or in exchange for other eligible securities of equivalent market value. The insolvency of the other party or other failure to repurchase the securities may delay the disposition of the underlying securities or cause the Fund to receive less than the full repurchase price. Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, any amounts received by the Fund in excess of the repurchase price and related transaction costs must be remitted to the other party. The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements in which eligible securities are transferred into joint trading accounts maintained by the custodian or sub-custodian for investment companies and other clients advised by the Fund s Adviser and its affiliates. The Fund will participate on a pro rata basis with the other investment companies and clients in its share of the securities transferred under such repurchase agreements and in its share of proceeds from any repurchase or other disposition of such securities. Investment Income, Gains and Losses, Expenses and Distributions Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized gains and losses from investment transactions are recorded on an identified-cost basis. Interest income and expenses are accrued daily. Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Foreign dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date or when the Fund is informed of the ex-dividend date. Distributions of net investment income, if any, are declared and paid monthly. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any, are recorded at fair value. Amortization/accretion of premium and discount is included in investment income. The detail of the total fund expense waiver and reimbursement of $7,836 is disclosed in Note 5. Federal Taxes It is the Fund s policy to comply with the Subchapter M provision of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ) and to distribute to shareholders each year substantially all of its income. Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax is necessary. As of and during the period ended February 28, 2022, the Fund did not have a liability for any uncertain tax positions. The Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to tax liabilities as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. As of February 28, 2022, tax years 2021 through 2022 remain subject to examination by the Fund s major tax jurisdictions, which include the United States of America and the State of Delaware. When-Issued and Delayed-Delivery Transactions The Fund may engage in when-issued or delayed-delivery transactions. The Fund records when-issued securities on the trade date and maintains security positions such that sufficient liquid assets will be available to make payment for the securities purchased. Securities purchased on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis are marked to market daily and begin earning interest on the settlement date. Losses may occur on these transactions due to changes in market conditions or the failure of counterparties to perform under the contract. Annual Shareholder Report 21 Restricted Securities The Fund may purchase securities which are considered restricted. Restricted securities are securities that either: (a) cannot be offered for public sale without first being registered, or being able to take advantage of an exemption from registration, under the Securities Act of 1933; or (b) are subject to contractual restrictions on public sales. In some cases, when a security cannot be offered for public sale without first being registered, the issuer of the restricted security has agreed to register such securities for resale, at the issuer s expense, either upon demand by the Fund or in connection with another registered offering of the securities. Many such restricted securities may be resold in the secondary market in transactions exempt from registration. Restricted securities may be determined to be liquid under criteria established by the Trustees. The Fund will not incur any registration costs upon such resales. The Fund s restricted securities, like other securities, are priced in accordance with procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Trustees. Other The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ materially from those estimated. The Fund applies investment company accounting and reporting guidance. 3. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST The following tables summarize share activity with respect to purchases and redemptions of Creation Units: 4. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION The tax character of distributions as reported on the Statement of Changes in Net Assets for the period ended February 28, 2022 was as follows: As of February 28, 2022, the components of distributable earnings on a tax-basis were as follows: Annual Shareholder Report 22 The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized depreciation is attributable to differing treatments for discount accretion/premium amortization on debt securities. At February 28, 2022, the cost of investments for federal tax purposes was $30,580,993. The net unrealized depreciation of investments for federal tax purposes was $783,436. This consists of net unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities having an excess of value over cost of $5,912 and net unrealized depreciation from investments for those securities having an excess of cost over value of $789,348. As of February 28, 2022, the Fund had a capital loss carryforward of $6,436 which will reduce the Fund s taxable income arising from future net realized gains on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Code, thereby reducing the amount of distributions to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Fund of any liability for federal income tax. Pursuant to the Code, these net capital losses retain their character as either short-term or long-term and do not expire. The following schedule summarizes the Fund s capital loss carryforwards: 5. INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES Investment Adviser Fee The advisory agreement between the Fund and the Adviser provides for an annual fee equal to 0.60% of the Fund s average daily net assets. Under the advisory agreement, the Adviser has contractually agreed to pay all operating expenses of the Fund under a unitary fee structure, except (i) interest and taxes (including, but not limited to, income, excise, transaction, transfer and withholding taxes) and registration fees and expenses; (ii) expenses of the Fund incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions and short sale dividend or interest expense; (iii) expenses incurred in connection with any distribution plan adopted by the Trust in compliance with Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, including distribution fees; (iv) Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses; (v) litigation expenses; (vi) proxy-related expenses; (vii) tax reclaim recovery expenses; and (viii) any expenses determined to be extraordinary expenses. Subject to the terms described in the Expense Limitation note, the Adviser may voluntarily choose to waive any portion of its fee and/or reimburse certain operating expenses of the Fund for competitive reasons such as to maintain the Fund s expense ratio, or as and when appropriate, to maintain positive or zero net yields. For the period ended February 28, 2022, the Adviser voluntarily waived $7,817 of its fee and voluntarily reimbursed $19 of other operating expenses. Administrative Fee Federated Administrative Services (FAS), under the Administrative Services Agreement, provides the Fund with administrative personnel and services. The Adviser not the Fund, pays FAS. Annual Shareholder Report 23 Distribution Services Fee The Fund has adopted a Distribution Plan (the Plan ) pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act. Under the terms of the Plan, the Fund will compensate Federated Securities Corp. (FSC), the principal distributor, from the daily net assets of the Fund to finance activities intended to result in the sale of these shares. The Plan provides that the Fund may incur distribution expenses of up to 0.25% of average daily net assets, annually, to compensate FSC. Subject to the terms described in the Expense Limitation note, FSC may voluntarily choose to waive any portion of its fee. For the period ended February 28, 2022, the Fund did not incur a distribution services fee; however, it may begin to incur this fee upon approval of the Trustees. Expense Limitation The Adviser and certain of its affiliates (which may include FAS or FSC) on their own initiative have agreed to waive certain amounts of their respective fees and/or reimburse expenses. Total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, taxes, litigation expenses, extraordinary expenses and proxy-related expenses paid by the Fund, if any) paid by the Fund (after the voluntary waivers and/or reimbursements) will not exceed 0.50% (the Fee Limit ) up to but not including the later of (the Termination Date ): (a) January 1, 2023; or (b) the date of the Fund s next effective Prospectus. These arrangements may only be terminated or the Fee Limit increased prior to the Termination Date with the agreement of the Fund s Trustees. Directors /Trustees and Miscellaneous Fees Certain Officers and Trustees of the Fund are Officers and Directors or Trustees of certain of the above companies. Affiliated Shares of Beneficial Interest As of February 28, 2022, a majority of the shares of beneficial interest outstanding are owned by an affiliate of the Adviser. 6. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS Purchases and sales of investments, excluding long-term U.S. government securities and short-term obligations, for the period ended February 28, 2022, were as follows: Purchases include $26,060,050 in connection with in-kind purchases of the Fund s Creation Units. 7. INTERFUND LENDING Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Fund, along with other funds advised by subsidiaries of Federated Hermes, Inc., may participate in an interfund lending program. This program provides an alternative credit facility allowing the Fund to borrow from other participating affiliated funds. As of February 28, 2022, there were no outstanding loans. During the period ended February 28, 2022, the program was not utilized. Annual Shareholder Report 24 8. OTHER MATTERS An outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus was first detected in China in late 2019 and subsequently spread globally. As of the date of the issuance of these financial statements, this coronavirus has resulted in closing borders, enhanced health screenings, disruptions to healthcare service preparation and delivery, quarantines, cancellations, and disruptions to supply chains, workflow operations and consumer activity, as well as general concern and uncertainty. The impact of this coronavirus may continue for an extended period of time and has resulted in substantial economic volatility. Health crises caused by outbreaks, such as the coronavirus outbreak, may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks. The impact of this outbreak, and other epidemics and pandemics that may arise in the future, could continue to negatively affect the worldwide economy, as well as the economies of individual countries, individual companies (including certain Fund service providers and issuers of the Fund s investments) and the markets in general in significant and unforeseen ways. Any such impact could adversely affect the Fund s performance. 9. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-01 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) . ASU No. 2021-01 updates and clarifies ASU No. 2020-04, which provides optional, temporary relief with respect to the financial reporting of contracts subject to certain types of modifications due to the planned discontinuation of LIBOR and other interbank-offered reference rates. The temporary relief provided by ASU No. 2021-01 is effective immediately for certain reference rate-related contract modifications that occur through December 31, 2022. Management does not expect ASU No. 2021-01 to have a material impact on the financial statements. Annual Shareholder Report 25 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF FEDERATED HERMES ETF TRUST AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FEDERATED HERMES SHORT DURATION HIGH YIELD ETF: Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Federated Hermes Short Duration High Yield ETF (the Fund ) (one of the portfolios constituting Federated Hermes ETF Trust (the Trust )), including the portfolio of investments, as of February 28, 2022, and the related statements of operations and changes in net assets and financial highlights for the period from December 16, 2021 (commencement of operations) through February 28, 2022 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund (one of the portfolios constituting Federated Hermes ETF Trust) at February 28, 2022, and the results of its operations, changes in net assets and financial highlights for the period from December 16, 2021 (commencement of operations) through February 28, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ( PCAOB ) and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Annual Shareholder Report 26 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of February 28, 2022, by correspondence with the custodian and others, or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from others were not received. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. We have served as the auditor of one or more Federated Hermes investment companies since 1979. Boston, Massachusetts April 22, 2022 Annual Shareholder Report 27 Shareholder Expense Example (unaudited) As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, which may include creation and redemption fees and brokerage commissions; and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees and to the extent applicable, distribution (12b-1) fees and/or other service fees and other Fund expenses. This Example is intended to help you to understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other funds. It is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period from September 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. ACTUAL EXPENSES The first section of the table below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this section, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you incurred over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first section under the heading entitled Expenses Paid During Period to estimate the expenses attributable to your investment during this period. HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES The second section of the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund s actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Fund s actual return. Thus, you should not use the hypothetical account values and expenses to estimate the actual ending account balance or your expenses for the period. Rather, these figures are required to be provided to enable you to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Fund with other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds. Annual Shareholder Report 28 Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transaction costs, such as creation and redemption fees and brokerage commissions. Therefore, the second section of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In addition, if these transaction costs were included, your costs would have been higher. Annual Shareholder Report 29 Board of Trustees and Trust Officers The Board of Trustees is responsible for managing the Trust s business affairs and for exercising all the Trust s powers except those reserved for the shareholders. The following tables give information about each Trustee and the senior officers of the Fund. Where required, the tables separately list Trustees who are interested persons of the Fund (i.e., Interested Trustees) and those who are not (i.e., Independent Trustees). Unless otherwise noted, the address of each person listed is 1001 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222-3779. The address of all Independent Trustees listed is 4000 Ericsson Drive, Warrendale, PA 15086-7561; Attention: Federated Hermes ETF Trust Board. As of December 31, 2021, the Trust comprised two portfolio(s), and the Federated Hermes Fund Family consisted of 33 investment companies (comprising 102 portfolios). Unless otherwise noted, each Officer is elected annually. Unless otherwise noted, each Trustee oversees all portfolios in the Federated Hermes Fund Family and serves for an indefinite term. The Fund s Statement of Additional Information includes additional information about Trust Trustees and is available, without charge and upon request, by calling 1-800-341-7400, Option #4. Interested TRUSTEES Background Annual Shareholder Report 30 * Family relationships and reasons for interested status: J. Christopher Donahue and Thomas R. Donahue are brothers. Both are interested due to their beneficial ownership of shares of Federated Hermes, Inc. and the positions they hold with Federated Hermes, Inc. and its subsidiaries. INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES Background Annual Shareholder Report 31 Annual Shareholder Report 32 Annual Shareholder Report 33 OFFICERS Annual Shareholder Report 34 Annual Shareholder Report 35 Evaluation and Approval of Advisory Contract August 2021 FEDERATED HERMES SHORT DURATION HIGH YIELD ETF (THE FUND ) At its meetings in August 2021 (the August Meetings ), the Fund s Board of Trustees (the Board ), including those Trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Independent Trustees ), reviewed and unanimously approved for an initial two-year term a proposed investment advisory contract (the Contract ) between the Fund and Federated Investment Management Company (the Adviser ). The Board s determination to approve the Contract reflects the exercise of its business judgment regarding whether to authorize the creation and offering of this new investment vehicle, as proposed by Federated Hermes, Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, Federated Hermes ), and is based on information requested by the Board and provided by Federated Hermes, as well as Federated Hermes recommendation to go forward with development of the Fund. The information, factors and conclusions that formed the basis for the Board s approval are summarized below. Information Received and Review Process At the request of the Independent Trustees, the Fund s Chief Compliance Officer (the CCO ) furnished to the Board in advance of its August Meetings an independent written evaluation presenting on the topics discussed below. The Board considered the CCO s independent written evaluation (the New Fund CCO Fee Evaluation Report ), along with other information, in evaluating the reasonableness of the Fund s proposed management fee and in determining to approve the Contract. The CCO, in preparing the New Fund CCO Fee Evaluation Report, has the authority to retain consultants, experts or staff as reasonably necessary to assist in the performance of his duties, reports directly to the Board, and can be terminated only with the approval of a majority of the Independent Trustees. In addition to the extensive materials that comprise and accompany the New Fund CCO Fee Evaluation Report, the Board considered the materials and presentations provided by Federated Hermes and the CCO s independent written evaluation in connection with the Board s annual approval of the continuation of the advisory and subadvisory contracts for the other funds advised by the Adviser and its affiliates (each, a Federated Hermes Fund ) at its May 2021 meetings. The Board also considered such additional matters as the Independent Trustees deemed reasonably necessary to evaluate the proposed Contract, which included detailed information about the Federated Hermes Funds and Federated Hermes furnished to the Board at its meetings throughout the year and in between regularly scheduled meetings on particular matters as the need arose. 36 The Board s consideration of the Contract included review of materials and information covering the following matters, among others: the Adviser s investment philosophy, revenue, profitability, personnel and processes; investment and operating strategies; the Fund s proposed investment objective; the Fund s anticipated expenses, including the proposed management fee and the overall estimated expense structure of the Fund (both in absolute terms and relative to a group of its peer funds), with due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations (if any); the use and allocation of brokerage commissions to be derived from trading the Fund s portfolio securities (if any); and the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to the Fund by the Adviser and its affiliates. The Board also considered the likely preferences and expectations of anticipated Fund shareholders; the entrepreneurial and other risks assumed by the Adviser in sponsoring and managing the Fund; the continuing state of competition in the exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) and mutual fund industry and market practices; the range of comparable fees for similar funds in the exchange-traded fund and mutual fund industry; the Fund s proposed relationship to the other Federated Hermes Funds, which include a comprehensive array of funds with different investment objectives, policies and strategies, and the benefits to shareholders of being part of the family of Federated Hermes Funds, compliance and audit reports concerning the Federated Hermes Funds and Federated Hermes affiliates that service them (including communications from regulatory agencies), as well as Federated Hermes responses to any issues raised therein; and relevant developments in the exchange-traded fund and mutual fund industry and how the Federated Hermes Funds and/or Federated Hermes may be responding to them. The Board noted that its evaluation process is evolutionary and that the criteria considered and the emphasis placed on relevant criteria may change in recognition of changing circumstances in the exchange-traded fund and mutual fund marketplace. The Board also considered judicial decisions concerning allegedly excessive investment advisory fees in determining to approve the Contract. Using these judicial decisions as a guide, the Board observed that the following factors may be relevant to an adviser s fiduciary duty with respect to its receipt of compensation from a fund: (1) the nature and quality of the services provided by an adviser to a fund and its shareholders (including the performance of the fund, its benchmark, and comparable funds); (2) an adviser s cost of providing the services (including the profitability to an adviser of providing advisory services to a fund); (3) the extent to which an adviser may realize economies of scale as a fund grows larger and, if such economies of scale exist, whether they have been appropriately shared with a fund and its shareholders or the family of funds; (4) any fall-out benefits that accrue to an adviser because of its relationship with a fund (including research services received from brokers that execute fund trades and any fees paid to affiliates of an adviser for services rendered to a fund); (5) comparative fee and expense structures (including a 37 comparison of fees paid to an adviser with those paid by similar funds both internally and externally as well as management fees charged to institutional and other advisory clients of the adviser for what might be viewed as like services); and (6) the extent of care, conscientiousness and independence with which the fund s board members perform their duties and their expertise (including whether they are fully informed about all facts the board deems relevant to its consideration of an adviser s services and fees). The Board noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) disclosure requirements regarding the basis for a fund board s approval of the fund s investment advisory contract generally align with the factors listed above. The Board was guided by these factors in its review of the proposed Contract to the extent it considered them to be appropriate and relevant, as discussed further below. The Board recognized that certain of the factors listed above (relating to such matters as anticipated Fund performance and any indirect benefits that may accrue to Federated Hermes as a result of the Adviser s proposed relationship with the Fund) are essentially impossible to apply before the Fund has experienced any meaningful operating history. The Board considered and weighed these factors in light of its substantial accumulated experience in governing the Federated Hermes Funds and working with Federated Hermes on matters relating to the Federated Hermes Funds. In determining to approve the Contract, the members of the Board reviewed and evaluated information and factors they believed to be relevant and appropriate through the exercise of their reasonable business judgment. While individual members of the Board may have weighed certain factors differently, the Board s determination to approve the Contract was based on a comprehensive consideration of all information provided to the Board. The Independent Trustees were assisted throughout the evaluation process by independent legal counsel. In connection with their deliberations at the August Meetings, the Independent Trustees met separately in executive session with their independent legal counsel and without management present to review the relevant materials and consider their responsibilities under applicable laws. In addition, senior management representatives of Federated Hermes also met with the Independent Trustees and their independent legal counsel to discuss the materials and presentations furnished to the Board at the August Meetings. Nature, Extent and Quality of Services The Board considered the nature, extent and quality of the services to be provided to the Fund by the Adviser and the resources of the Adviser and its affiliates to be dedicated to the Fund. In this regard, the Board evaluated, among other things, the proposed terms of the Contract and the range of services to be provided to the Fund by the Adviser and its affiliates. The Board considered the Adviser s personnel, investment philosophy and process, investment research capabilities and resources, trade execution capabilities, experience and performance track record. The Board reviewed the qualifications, backgrounds and responsibilities of the portfolio management 38 team that will be primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund and the Adviser s ability and experience in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to service the proposed Fund. In particular, the Board considered the abilities and experience of the portfolio managers in analyzing factors such as special considerations relevant to investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of U.S. dollar-denominated high-yield fixed-income instruments. The Board also evaluated the Fund s anticipated ability to deliver competitive performance when compared to its Peer Group (as defined below) as a useful indicator of the Adviser s anticipated ability to execute the Fund s investment program. In addition, the Board considered the financial resources and overall reputation of Federated Hermes and its willingness to consider and make investments in personnel, infrastructure, technology, cybersecurity, business continuity planning and operational enhancements that are designed to benefit the Federated Hermes Funds. The Board also considered its past experience with the Adviser with respect to the services it provides to other Federated Hermes Funds. The Board considered that, although the Fund would be among the first ETFs managed by the Adviser, the Adviser had extensive experience advising actively managed mutual funds, including mutual funds with similar strategies to those of the Fund. The Board noted the significant acquisition of Hermes Fund Managers Limited by Federated Hermes in 2018, which has deepened the organization s investment management expertise and capabilities and expanded the investment process for all of the Federated Hermes Funds to have access to analytical resources related to environmental, social and governance ( ESG ) factors and issuer engagement on ESG matters. The Board considered the special attributes of the Fund as an ETF relative to a traditional mutual fund and the benefits that are expected to be realized from an investment in the Fund, rather than a traditional mutual fund. The Board also considered the resources devoted by Federated Hermes in developing and maintaining an infrastructure necessary to support the on-going operations of the Fund. The Board considered the quality of the Adviser s communications with the Board and responsiveness to Board inquiries and requests made from time to time with respect to the other Federated Hermes Funds. In this regard, the Board took into account the Adviser s communications with the Board in light of the market volatility amidst the pandemic. The Board also considered that Federated Hermes is responsible for providing the Federated Hermes Funds officers. The Board also considered information previously provided by the Adviser regarding its regulatory and compliance environment. The Board considered the Adviser s compliance program, compliance history, and reports from the CCO about the Adviser s compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including responses to regulatory developments and any compliance or other issues raised by regulatory agencies. The Board also noted Federated Hermes 39 support of the Federated Hermes Funds compliance control structure and, in particular, the compliance-related resources that would be devoted by the Adviser and its affiliates in support of the Fund s obligations pursuant to Rule 38a-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, including the Adviser s commitment to respond to rulemaking and other regulatory initiatives of the SEC. The Board considered Federated Hermes day-to-day oversight of the Federated Hermes Funds compliance with their investment objectives and policies as well as with applicable laws and regulations, noting that regulatory and other developments had over time led to an increase in the scope of Federated Hermes oversight in this regard, including in connection with the designation of the Federated Hermes Funds investment advisers as the administrators of the Federated Hermes Funds liquidity risk management program. The Board also considered discussions with Federated Hermes regarding the implementation of its business continuity plans and recognized steps taken by Federated Hermes to continue to provide the same nature, extent and quality of services to the Federated Hermes Funds during the pandemic. In addition, the Board noted Federated Hermes commitment to maintaining high quality systems and expending substantial resources to prepare for and respond to ongoing changes due to the market, regulatory and control environments in which the Fund and its service providers would operate, including changes associated with the pandemic. Based on these considerations, the Board concluded that it was satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of the investment management and related services to be provided to the Fund by the Adviser and that the approval of the Contract was warranted. Fund Investment Performance The Board noted that the Fund is newly formed and has no prior performance history. The Board considered the investment performance of the Adviser and its significant history of managing short duration fixed-income portfolios. The Board also received additional information about the broad range of the portfolio management team s investment experience and their investment philosophy and process, including with respect to the Fund s proposed investments primarily in a diversified portfolio of U.S. dollar-denominated high-yield fixed-income instruments. Based on these considerations, the Board concluded that it was satisfied that the Adviser has the capability of providing satisfactory investment performance for the Fund. Fund Expenses The Board considered the proposed management fee and overall proposed expense structure of the Fund and the comparative fee and expense information that had been provided in connection with the May Meetings. In this regard, the Board was presented with, and considered, information regarding the 40 proposed contractual management fee rates, proposed net management fee rates, and anticipated total expense ratios relative to (i) traditional mutual funds with an institutional share class within the category of peer funds selected by Morningstar, Inc. , an independent fund ranking organization (the Peer Group ) and (ii) actively managed ETFs within the Peer Group. The Board noted the CCO s view that comparisons to fund peer groups may be helpful, though not conclusive, in evaluating the reasonableness of the Fund s fees. The Board considered, in evaluating such comparisons, that in some cases there may be differences in the funds objectives or investment management techniques, or the costs to implement the funds, even within the same Peer Group. The Board noted information about structural, operational and other differences between ETFs and traditional mutual funds, including differences in the marketplace in which each type of product must compete. While mindful that courts have cautioned against giving too much weight to comparative information concerning fees charged by other advisers for managing funds with comparable investment programs, the Board noted that it found the use of such comparisons to be relevant to its deliberations. The Board focused on comparisons with other similar exchange-traded funds and mutual funds more heavily than exchange-traded funds and mutual funds products or services because such comparisons are believed to be more relevant. The Board considered that other exchange-traded funds and mutual funds are the products most like the Fund, in that they are readily available to Fund shareholders as alternative investment vehicles, and they are the type of investment vehicle, in fact, anticipated to be chosen and maintained by the Fund s anticipated shareholders. The Board noted that the range of such other exchange-traded funds and mutual funds fees and expenses, therefore, appears to be a relevant indicator of what consumers have found to be reasonable in the marketplace in which the Fund will compete. The Board also considered competition in the general ETF marketplace and the impact of market pressures on the price levels for actively managed ETFs such as the Fund. The Board reviewed the proposed contractual management fee rate, proposed net management fee rate and anticipated total expense ratio of the Fund and noted the position of the Fund s proposed fee rates relative to its Peer Group. In this regard, the Board noted that the proposed contractual management fee rate of the Fund was above the median of the Peer Group. The Board also noted that most of the funds in the Fund s Peer Group do not charge a unitary fee from which operational expenses are paid. Consistent with general ETF practice, the Board noted the Fund s unitary fee structure, under which the Adviser would, in addition to providing investment management services, arrange for transfer agency, custody, fund administration and accounting, and other non-distribution related services necessary for the Fund to operate. The Board considered that, other than the management fee, the Adviser would pay all operating expenses of the Fund, 41 except for: (i) interest and taxes (including, but not limited to, income, excise, transaction, transfer and withholding taxes); (ii) expenses of the Fund incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions and short sale dividend or interest expense; (iii) expenses incurred in connection with any distribution plan adopted by the Trust in compliance with Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, including distribution fees; (iv) acquired fund fees and expenses; (v) litigation expenses; (vi) proxy-related expenses; (vii) tax reclaim recovery expenses; and (viii) any expenses determined to be extraordinary expenses. While Federated Hermes does not currently offer a Short-Term High Yield investment strategy either in a separate account or another Federated Hermes Fund, the Board previously received and considered information about the fees charged by Federated Hermes for advisory services provided by the High Yield investment team to other types of clients, including non-registered non-exchange-traded or mutual fund clients (such as institutional separate accounts) and third-party unaffiliated mutual funds for which the Adviser or its affiliates serve as sub-adviser. The Board noted the CCO s conclusion that registered fund clients are inherently different products due to the following differences, among others: (i) different types of targeted investors; (ii) different applicable laws and regulations; (iii) different legal structures; (iv) different average account sizes and portfolio management techniques made necessary by different cash flows and different associated costs; (v) the time spent by portfolio managers and their teams (among other personnel across various departments, including legal, compliance and risk management) in reviewing securities pricing, addressing different administrative responsibilities, and addressing different degrees of risk associated with management; and (vi) a variety of different costs. The Board noted that the CCO did not consider the fees for providing advisory services to other types of clients to be determinative in judging the appropriateness of the Federated Hermes Funds advisory fees. The Board considered the CCO s conclusion that the proposed management fee was reasonable. The Board reviewed the proposed fees and anticipated total expense ratio of the Fund and was satisfied that the proposed overall expense structure of the Fund appeared to be appropriate. Profitability and Other Benefits The Board considered other benefits to the Adviser and its affiliates from their relationships with the Fund. In connection with the Board s governance of other Federated Hermes Funds, the Board regularly receives financial information about Federated Hermes, including information regarding the compensation and ancillary (or fall-out ) benefits that Federated Hermes derived from its relationships with the Federated Hermes Funds. This information covers not only the fees under the Federated Hermes Funds 42 investment advisory contracts, but also fees received by Federated Hermes affiliates for providing other services to the Federated Hermes Funds under separate contracts (e.g., for serving as the Federated Hermes Funds administrator and distributor). In this regard, the Board considered that certain of Federated Hermes affiliates provide distribution and shareholder services to the Federated Hermes Funds, for which they may be compensated through distribution and servicing fees paid pursuant to Rule 12b-1 plans or otherwise. The Board also received and considered information detailing any indirect benefit that Federated Hermes may derive from its receipt of research services from brokers who execute portfolio trades for the Federated Hermes Funds. In addition, the Board considered that, in order for the Federated Hermes Funds to remain competitive in the marketplace, the Adviser and its affiliates frequently waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses and have disclosed to Federated Hermes Fund shareholders and/or reported to the Board their intention to do so (or continue to do so) in the future. Moreover, the Board received and considered regular reports from Federated Hermes throughout the year as to the institution, adjustment or elimination of these voluntary waivers and/or reimbursements. The Board received and considered information furnished by Federated Hermes, as requested by the CCO, that reported projected revenues for the Fund, as detailed cost allocation reports had not yet been projected for the Fund. The Board considered the CCO s view that, while these cost allocation reports apply consistent allocation processes, the inherent difficulties in allocating costs continue to cause the CCO to question the precision of the process and to conclude that such reports may be unreliable because a single change in an allocation estimate may dramatically alter the resulting estimate of cost and/or profitability of a Federated Hermes Fund and may produce unintended consequences. The Board considered that the Fund was new to Federated Hermes and noted the CCO s view that any projected cost allocation and/or profit margin does not represent the full or actual cost of operating a Federated Hermes Fund and makes only rough estimates of the cost to launch a Federated Hermes Fund. The Board also considered the CCO s view that, while the Fund is expected to grow in size, the creation and maintenance of the Fund requires a substantial initial investment. The allocation information, including the CCO s view that estimations regarding the Fund may be unreliable, was considered in the evaluation by the Board. The Board also considered information regarding the CCO s review of information compiled by Federated Hermes comparing its profitability information to other publicly held fund management companies. The Board considered that the CCO noted that Federated Hermes regularly undertakes to establish new Federated Hermes Funds and maintains a number of other smaller Federated Hermes Funds that, while expected to grow to a greater size, nevertheless require substantial investment and waiver or assumption of fees and other expenses in order to deliver them to the marketplace. 43 The Board considered the CCO s conclusion that, based on such profitability information, Federated Hermes profit margins did not appear to be excessive. The Board also considered the CCO s view that Federated Hermes appeared financially sound, with the resources necessary to fulfill its obligations under its contracts with the Federated Hermes Funds, including the proposed Contract. Economies of Scale The Board received and considered information about the notion of possible realization of economies of scale as a fund grows larger, the difficulties of calculating economies of scale at an individual fund level, and the extent to which potential scale benefits are shared with shareholders. The Board considered that any reduction in fixed costs associated with the management of the Fund would benefit the Adviser due to the unitary fee structure of the Fund, but that the unitary fee would protect shareholders from a rise in operating costs and/or a decline in Fund assets and is a transparent means of informing the Fund s shareholders of the fees associated with the Fund. The Board also considered that Federated Hermes has made significant and long-term investments in areas that support all of the Federated Hermes Funds, such as personnel and processes for the portfolio management (including market data on which portfolio managers make investment decisions), trading operations, issuer engagement (including with respect to ESG matters), shareholder services, compliance, business continuity, internal audit and risk management functions, as well as systems technology (including technology relating to cybersecurity) and use of data. The Board noted that Federated Hermes investments in these areas are extensive and are designed to provide enhanced services to the Federated Hermes Funds and their shareholders. The Board considered that the benefits of these investments (as well as the benefits of any economies of scale, should they exist) are likely to be shared with the family of Federated Hermes Funds as a whole. In addition, the Board considered that the Adviser and its affiliates have frequently waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses for the Federated Hermes Funds and that such waivers and reimbursements are another means for potential economies of scale to be shared with shareholders and can provide protection from an increase in expenses if a Federated Hermes Fund s assets decline. The Board noted the fee waiver arrangement proposed for the Fund. In connection with the Board s governance of other Federated Hermes Funds, the Board regularly receives information furnished by Federated Hermes regarding adviser-paid fees (commonly referred to as revenue sharing ). The Board considered the beliefs of Federated Hermes and the CCO that this information should be viewed to determine if there was an incentive to either not apply breakpoints, or to apply breakpoints at higher levels, and should not be viewed to determine the appropriateness of advisory fees. The Board also noted the absence of any applicable regulatory or industry guidelines on this subject, which is compounded by the lack of any common 44 industry practice or general pattern with respect to structuring fund management fees with breakpoints that serve to reduce the fees as a fund attains a certain size. The Board considered that the CCO did not recommend institution of breakpoints in pricing Federated Hermes proposed investment management services to the Fund at this time. The Board noted that, as part of its future annual review of the Contract, it will review asset growth in the Fund, whether economies of scale that can be reasonably identified have been achieved, and the extent to which such economies of scale may be shared with Fund shareholders. Conclusions The Board considered: (i) the CCO s conclusion that his observations and the information accompanying the New Fund CCO Fee Evaluation Report show that the proposed management fee for the Fund was reasonable; and (ii) the CCO s recommendation that the Board approve the proposed management fee. On the basis of the information and factors summarized above, among other information and factors deemed relevant by the Board, and the evaluation thereof, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, unanimously voted to approve the Contract. The Board based its determination to approve the Contract on the totality of the circumstances and relevant factors and with a view of past and future long-term considerations. Not all of the factors and considerations identified above were necessarily deemed to be relevant to the Fund, nor did the Board consider any one of them to be determinative. With respect to the factors that were deemed to be relevant, the Board s determination to approve the Contract reflects its view that Federated Hermes proposal to establish and manage the Fund and its past performance and actions in providing services to other Federated Hermes Funds (which the Board has found to be satisfactory with respect to such other Federated Hermes Funds) provided a satisfactory basis to support the determination to approve the proposed arrangement.

The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditor in order to assure that the provision of such services do not impair the auditor s independence. Unless a type of service to be provided by the independent auditor has received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. Certain services have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The term of the general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a different period. The Audit Committee will annually review the services that may be provided by the independent auditor without obtaining specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee and may grant general pre-approval for such services. The Audit Committee will revise the list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent determinations. The Audit Committee will not delegate to management its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to its chairman (the Chairman ) for services that do not exceed a specified dollar threshold. The Chairman or Chief Audit Executive will report any such pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Committee will designate another member with such pre-approval authority when the Chairman is unavailable. AUDIT SERVICES The annual audit services engagement terms and fees will be subject to the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will approve, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, registered investment company (RIC) structure or other matters. In addition to the annual audit services engagement specifically approved by the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval for other audit services, which are those services that only the independent auditor reasonably can provide. The Audit Committee has pre-approved certain audit services; with limited exception, all other audit services must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee. AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the RIC s financial statements or that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor. The Audit Committee believes that the provision of audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor, and has pre-approved certain audit-related services; all other audit-related services must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee. TAX SERVICES The Audit Committee believes that the independent auditor can provide tax services to the RIC such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without impairing the auditor s independence. However, the Audit Committee will not permit the retention of the independent auditor in connection with a transaction initially recommended by the independent auditor, the purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. The Audit Committee has pre-approved certain tax services; with limited exception, all tax services involving large and complex transactions must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee. ALL OTHER SERVICES With respect to the provision of permissible services other than audit, review or attest services the pre-approval requirement is waived if: The Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit services which qualify for pre-approval and which it believes are routine and recurring services, and would not impair the independence of the auditor. The Securities and Exchange Commission s (the SEC ) rules and relevant guidance should be consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions. PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS Pre-approval fee levels for all services to be provided by the independent auditor will be established annually by the Audit Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. PROCEDURES Requests or applications to provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit Committee by the Fund s Principal Accounting Officer and/or the Chief Audit Executive of Federated Hermes, Inc., only after those individuals have determined that the request or application is consistent with the SEC s rules on auditor independence.
